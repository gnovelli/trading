## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

This algorithmic trading system is developed **exclusively for educational and learning purposes** in the context of **Reinforcement Learning**. The system **does not perform real trading operations** but **simulates trading decisions** based on a Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

The code provides a basic solution to understand the dynamics of algorithmic trading systems and may serve as a starting point for future developments.

### ❗ **Warnings**

- This system is a simulation and **does not interact with real trading platforms**.
- The decisions made by the system are the result of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm and do not represent actual investment advice or strategies.
- The developers and contributors of the project **assume no responsibility** for the misuse of the code.

**It is recommended to use this system for study and research purposes only.**
